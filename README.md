# Examples from Go Programming Language

This is a simple repo for code written while reading 
[The Go Programming Language by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Alan-Donovan/dp/0134190440).

Additionally, I have set up [gogradle](https://github.com/gogradle/gogradle) for building and dependency 
management purposes. A layered Dockerfile for automatic building 
and serving will be provided.
